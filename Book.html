            <p class="pd1">
                The Power of Your Subconscious Mind has been a bestseller since its first publication in 1963, 
                selling many millions of copies since its original publication. It is one of the most brilliant 
                and beloved spiritual self-help works of all time which can help you heal yourself, 
                banish your fears, sleep better, enjoy better relationships and just feel happier.
                 The techniques are simple and results come quickly. You can improve your relationships,
                your finances, your physical well-being. 
                <p class="pd1" >        
                     Dr.Joseph Murphy explains that life events are actually the result of the workings of your conscious
                     and subconscious minds. He suggests practical techniques through which one can change one's destiny
                     principally by focusing and redirecting this miraculous energy. Years of research studying the world's 
                     major religions convinced him that some Great Power lay behind all spiritual life and that this power 
                     is within each of us.
                    
                     The Power of Your Subconscious Mind will open a world of success, happiness, prosperity, and peace for you.

            <p class="BookTitle"><strong>Book 2:Think and Grow Rich</strong></p>
        

            <p class="pd2">
                Think and Grow Rich is a guide to success by Napoleon Hill, which was 
                first published in 1937 following the Great Depression. It was immediately
                welcomed as an antidote to hard times and remained a bestseller for decades.
                Many people still find its philosophy of positive thinking and its specific
                steps for achieving wealth both relevant and life-changing. Hill contends
                that our thoughts become our reality, and offers a plan and principles for 
                transforming thoughts into riches, including visualization, affirmation,
                creating a Master Mind group, defining a goal, and planning.

                        Napoleon Hill was born in Wise County, Virginia. 
                        He began his writing career at age 13 as a "mountain reporter"
                        for small town newspapers and went on to become America's most
                        beloved motivational author. His work stands as a monument to 
                        individual achievement and is the cornerstone of modern motivation. 
                        His most famous work, Think and Grow Rich, is one of the best-selling
                        books of all time. Hill established the Foundation as a nonprofit
                        educational institution whose mission is to perpetuate his philosophy
                        of leadership, self-motivation, and individual achievement.

            <p class="BookTitle"><strong>Book 3: Atomic Habits</strong></p>
        

            <p class="pd1">
                People think that when you want to change your life,
                you need to think big. But world-renowned habits expert James Clear
                has discovered another way. He knows that real change comes from the 
                compound effect of hundreds of small decisions: doing two push-ups a
                day, waking up five minutes early, or holding a single short phone call.
                He calls them <strong>Atomic Habits</strong>.
                <p class="pd1" >        
                    In this ground-breaking book, Clears reveals exactly how these minuscule
                    changes can grow into such life-altering outcomes. He uncovers a handful
                    of simple life hacks (the forgotten art of Habit Stacking, the unexpected
                    power of the Two Minute Rule, or the trick to entering the Goldilocks Zone),
                    and delves into cutting-edge psychology and neuroscience to explain why
                    they matter. Along the way, he tells inspiring stories of 
                    Olympic gold medalists, leading CEOs, and distinguished scientists
                    who have used the science of tiny habits to stay productive, motivated, and happy.
